## A Toast to Two Years 🍷

As **Einstein** once said, _“Coincidences are God’s way of remaining anonymous.”_

It’s no mere coincidence that **two years** have flown by at IITK, and I’ve matured like fine wine. The memories? Too many to count. The brain? Too small to hold them all! But I’ve found a way to lighten the load by sharing my journey with you all.

**Date:** _28th October_  
**Occasion:** _2nd Year Anniversary at IITK_

## Leopard Note 🐆

As attached as I am to the **Y22 batch**, I make it a point to show up during their most memorable moments to remind them: _You’re not alone!_ Be ready to meet my family in the real world!

Thanks for being there during:

1. **First Year Orientation**
2. **Intern Season**
3. **Second Year Anniversary**

This post is a letter to commemorate _Mr. Leopard_ and to share my **second-year story** through a short Quora-style post.

## Dear Mr. Leopard,

Phew, where do I start? _God, can I get some hooks to nail this opening?_

Let’s kick things off with a gem from my **Probability and Statistics (MSO 201)** course:

### Central Limit Theorem 📊

**Google Definition:**

> The central limit theorem says that the sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large enough. Regardless of whether the population has a normal, Poisson, binomial, or any other distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean will be NORMAL.

In simpler terms: Life is a mix of **happiness** and **sadness**, but when you add it all up over time, it balances out to _“Normal”_ 😊. Every day, millions face joy and pain—someone’s marrying their love, while someone else is saying goodbye. As _House_ once said, _“The world always seems to balance itself out.”_

## Life at IITK: A Beautiful Chaos 🌪️

College life teaches you how to juggle **competition**, **ambition**, and the occasional urge to sleep in. Waking up on time? An achievement. Sneaking off to the **canteen** for senseless banter? A lifestyle.

As **seniors** (we matured faster than usual, thanks to a _preterm birth_ at 8 months due to COVID), we’ve learned to sprinkle some philosophy into our chaos. Here’s my take on surviving the **pursuit of happiness** at IITK.

### The Internship Prep Saga 💼

The transition from second to third year is a wake-up call. Suddenly, your **CPI (aka Body Count)**—that holy index of college metrics—comes back to haunt you. It’s like:

- _Step 1:_ Make friends.
- _Step 2:_ Take a job.
- _Step 3:_ Leave.

Spoiler: We weren’t ready for Step 3. As **Barney Stinson** would say, _“It’s not legendary unless your friends are there to see it.”_ Jokes on them—there wasn’t anything legendary to see! 😜

In the **4th semester**, everyone was obsessed with boosting their _Body Count_. Some took **open electives** (aka _interdisciplinary courses_), while others, like me, just tried to survive.

## My 4th Semester Chronicles 📜

Here’s a rundown of my _normal_ (or not-so-normal) moments:

- **Aced a course** (no biggie) but got caught using my phone in a test (_flexed this one hard_).
- **Donated money** to friends who’ll never repay (unless I threaten them).
- **Stole a calculator** before a test (don’t judge).
- **Abused someone**, got beaten back.
- **Guided a junior**, begged a senior (_Sharvil Athaley_) for PYQs.
- **Kissed a girl** in dreams, kissed boys in reality (oops).
- **Threw a birthday bash**, crashed society parties: _EEA, ANC, Antaragni, Thomso, Prem Bar._
- **Stuck in someone’s brain**, couldn’t escape someone’s room/life 😅.
- **Partied with others**, parted _by_ others.
- **Coded, simulated, deployed.**
- **Gave interviews**: _EEA Secy, EE Dept Convener (Amey Raj)._
- **Took a DSA course** and survived a _treasure hunt poem_.

And oh, I claimed to have done _some normal_.
